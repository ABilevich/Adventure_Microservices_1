This project was made to learn microservices.

The simple architecture is as follows

- Order Service: Used to create orders
- Inventory Service: keeps track of inventory
- Product Service: Manages product creation and listing

The idea is to test both event based and synchronous communication between microservices.

- Api Gateway: Acts as an entrypoint to the requests (Spring Cloud Gateway)
